Quantitive-Investing
====================

Being eager to find the habits of stocks market, we create this project in summer,2013, which would try to apply machine learning techniques and develop our own algorithms. Also, that's also for my thesis. 

We begin with some trading strategies, some of them are really simple,indeed. To my surprise was, however, these simple things behaved much better than most of investors (actually, I was). 

So we keep promoting the project, step by step, with elegance and confidence.
