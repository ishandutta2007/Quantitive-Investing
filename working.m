%% ==================== Part 1: Two Different Trading Style ====================
%  This part was designed to comapre two different trading styles, and 
%  give you a intuition about the price fluctuation.
%
% How this idea come to me?
%  I was trapped by the fluctuation easily when I joined the market and
%  became a green investor. The reason behind would be the mentality,
%  concretely, I'm too sensetive to exposure to the risk, which can be seen
%  everywhere in our world, especially in financial market.
%
%  Facing the vast jump of the price, generally, we just let a sigh of
%  despair.
